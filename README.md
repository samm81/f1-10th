# f1-10th

Code for the [f1/10th project](http://f1tenth.org/). Forked from the f1/10th public code repo. Worked on for [Dr. Mok's Cyberphysical Systems class at UT Austin for the Spring 2016 semester](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~mok/cs378/Spring16/Syllabus.htm).

## Dependencies
[ROS](http://www.ros.org/) indigo is needed to run the code. This code will not run on its own - it must be dropped into an appropriate ROS environment. Following the tutorials and dropping this code in the appropriate spots will get the best results.
The model car is needed to run the code on. We were provided this by Dr. Mok, who got it from the UPenn team.
